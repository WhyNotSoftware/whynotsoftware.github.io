title: "Why Not a Function #30: id"
---

	(import '(java.util UUID))

	(defn id ([] (id 0)) ([n] (UUID. 1 n)))

`id` is a very simple function useful for creating UUIDs in tests. We can pass a number which will be used for the minor bits.
    
	(id)
	=> #uuid"00000000-0000-0001-0000-000000000000"

	(id 1)
	=> #uuid"00000000-0000-0001-0000-000000000001"
